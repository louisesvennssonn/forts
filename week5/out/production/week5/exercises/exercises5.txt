- If you're new to programming, 1-4 will prepare for lab4
  (do at least 1-2). As usual, can't spend all your time here. Do left over exercises
  later or as exam recap.

Exercises
---------

1.  See ex1useaclass directory. Implement the class Rational so that all tests
    in Ex1TestRational pass.

    TIP: Always store rationals in shortest form,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm

    TIP: It's possible to generate the equals and hashCode methods (possibly modify
    and/or clean up a bit)

2.  See ex2usemoreclasses. Implement classes Point and Triangle so that all test
    in Ex2TestPointTriangle passes. Triangle should use Point and should use Herons
    formula to calculate the area, See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula

3.  See Ex3Theory. Uncomment and answer questions. Write answer here

4.  See directory ex4hangman. Implement a text based object oriented version of the Hangman game
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game).

    - All classes needed are there.
    - Break down and decide which data and which method in which classes.
    - The main class, with the game loop is CLI (also contains all IO)
    - Let CLI do calls on the HangMan class (only) to do the work. Hangman will in
      turn delegate to other objects to fulfill their part of the work.
    - Make a sketch discuss with assistants

    A run of the game outputs:

    Welcome to HangMan, try to guess the word! It's 7 char long
    Enter a char > i

    i _ _ _ _ _ _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|

    i _ _ _ _ _ _
    Enter a char > n
    ---|

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |
       O

    ... (etc)

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |
       O
      /|\
      /
    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a char > x
    ---|
       |
       O
      /|\
      / \

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Sorry you lost. Word was: instans

    (if win: Congratulation you made it! Word was ..)


5.  See Ex5SplitList. Implement a method to partition a list into sub lists.
    Optionally make method generic.

6.  See Ex6Grouping. Group a list of Positions (row, col) into sub lists in which all
    positions have the same row. You should use Map/HashMap.
